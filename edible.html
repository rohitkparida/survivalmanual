            <p>In a survival situation, plants can provide food and medicine. Their safe use requires absolutely positive identification, knowing how to prepare them for eating, and knowing any dangerous properties they might have. Familiarity with botanical structures of plants and information on where they grow will make them easier to locate and identify. This appendix provides pictures, descriptions, habitats and distribution, and edible parts of the most common plants that you might encounter.</p>

            <p><strong>Abal</strong>
            <em>Calligonum comosum</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The abal is one of the few shrubby plants that exist in the shady deserts. This plant grows to about 1.2 meters (4 feet), and its branches look like wisps from a broom. The stiff, green branches produce an abundance of flowers in March and April.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> This plant is found in desert scrub and waste in any climatic zone. It inhabits much of the North African desert. It may also be found on the desert sands of the Middle East and as far eastward as the Rajputana desert of western India.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> This plant's general appearance would not indicate its usefulness to you, but while this plant is flowering in the spring, its fresh flowers can be eaten. It is common in the areas where it is found. An analysis of the abal's food value has shown it to be high in sugar and nitrogenous components.</p>

            <p><strong>Acacia</strong>
            <em>Acacia farnesiana</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Acacia is a spreading, usually short tree with spines and alternate compound leaves. Its individual leaflets are small. Its flowers are ball-shaped, bright yellow, and very fragrant. Its bark is a whitish-gray color. Its fruits are dark brown and podlike.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Acacia grows in open, sunny areas. It is found throughout all tropical regions.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are about 500 species of acacia. These plants are especially prevalent in Africa, southern Asia, and Australia, but many species are found in the warmer and drier parts of America.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> Its young leaves, flowers, and pods are edible raw or cooked.</p>

            <p><strong>Agave</strong>
            <em>Agave</em> species</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> These plants have large clusters of thick, fleshy leaves borne close to the ground and surrounding a central stalk. The plants flower only once, then die. They produce a massive flower stalk.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Agaves prefer dry, open areas. They are found throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of the western deserts of the United States and Mexico.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> Its flowers and flower buds are edible. Boil them before eating.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>The juice of some species causes dermatitis in some individuals.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Other Uses:</strong> Cut the huge flower stalk and collect the juice for drinking. Some species have very fibrous leaves. Pound the leaves and remove the fibers for weaving and making ropes. Most species have thick, sharp needles at the tips of the leaves. Use them for sewing or making hacks. The sap of some species contains a chemical that makes the sap suitable for use as a soap.</p>

            <p><strong>Almond</strong>
            <em>Prunus amygdalus</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The almond tree, which sometimes grows to 12.2 meters (40 feet), looks like a peach tree. The fresh almond fruit resembles a gnarled, unripe peach and grows in clusters. The stone (the almond itself) is covered with a thick, dry, woolly skin.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Almonds are found in the scrub and thorn forests of the tropics, the evergreen scrub forests of temperate areas, and in desert scrub and waste in all climatic zones. The almond tree is also found in the semidesert areas of the Old World in southern Europe, the eastern Mediterranean, Iran, the Middle East, China, Madeira, the Azores, and the Canary Islands.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The mature almond fruit splits open lengthwise down the side, exposing the ripe almond nut. You can easily get the dry kernel by simply cracking open the stone. Almond meats are rich in food value, like all nuts. Gather them in large quantities and shell them for further use as survival food. You could live solely on almonds for rather long periods. When you boil them, the kernel's outer covering comes off and only the white meat remains.</p>

            <p><strong>Amaranth</strong>
            <em>Amaranthus</em> species</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> These plants, which grow 90 to 150 centimeters (35 to 60 inches) tall, are abundant weeds in many parts of the world. All amaranth have alternate simple leaves. They may have some red color present on the stems. They bear minute, greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the plants. Their seeds may be brown or black in weedy species and light-colored in domestic species.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Look for amaranth along roadsides, in disturbed waste areas, or as weeds in crops throughout the world. Some amaranth species have been grown as a grain crop and a garden vegetable in various parts of the world, especially in South America.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> All parts are edible, but some may have sharp spines you should remove before eating. The young plants or the growing tips of older plants are an excellent vegetable. Simply boil the young plants or eat them raw. Their seeds are very nutritious. Shake the tops of older plants to get the seeds. Eat the seeds raw, boiled, ground into flour, or popped like popcorn.</p>

            <p><strong>Arctic willow</strong>
            <em>Salix arctica</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The arctic willow is a shrub that never exceeds more than 60 centimeters (24 inches) in height and grows in clumps that form dense mats on the tundra.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> The arctic willow is common on tundras in North America, Europe, and Asia. You can also find it in some mountainous areas in temperate regions.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> You can collect the succulent, tender young shoots of the arctic willow in early spring. Strip off the outer bark of the new shoots and eat the inner portion raw. You can also peel and eat raw the young underground shoots of any of the various kinds of arctic willow. Young willow leaves are one of the richest sources of vitamin C, containing 7 to 10 times more than an orange.</p>

            <p><strong>Arrowroot</strong>_
            Maranta and Sagittaria_ species</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The arrowroot is an aquatic plant with arrow-shaped leaves and potatolike tubers in the mud.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Arrowroot is found worldwide in temperate zones and the tropics. It is found in moist to wet habitats.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The rootstock is a rich source of high quality starch. Boil the rootstock and eat it as a vegetable.</p>

            <p><strong>Beech</strong>
            <em>Fagus</em> species</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Beech trees are large (9 to 24 meters [30 to 80 feet]), symmetrical forest trees that have smooth, light-gray bark and dark green foliage. The character of its bark, plus its clusters of prickly seedpods, clearly distinguish the beech tree in the field.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> This tree is found in the temperate zone. It grows wild in the eastern United States, Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is found in moist areas, mainly in the forests. This tree is common throughout southeastern Europe and across temperate Asia. Beech relatives are also found in Chile, New Guinea, and New Zealand.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The mature beechnuts readily fall out of the husklike seedpods. You can eat these dark-brown, triangular nuts by breaking the thin shell with your fingernail and removing the white, sweet kernel inside. Beechnuts are one of the most delicious of all wild nuts. They are a most useful survival food because of the kernel's high oil content. You can also use the beechnuts as a coffee substitute. Roast them so that the kernel becomes golden brown and quite hard. Then pulverize the kernel and, after boiling or steeping in hot water, you have a passable coffee substitute.</p>

            <p><strong>Cattail</strong>
            <em>Typha latifolia</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Cattails are grasslike plants with strap-shaped leaves 1 to 5 centimeters (1/4 to 2 inches) wide and growing up to 1.8 meters (6 feet) tall. The male flowers are borne in a dense mass above the female flowers. The male flowers last only a short time, leaving the female flowers, which develop into the brown cattail. Pollen from the male flowers is often abundant and bright yellow.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Cattails are found throughout most of the world. Look for them in full sun areas at the margins of lakes, streams, canals, rivers, and brackish water.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The young tender shoots are edible raw or cooked. The rhizome is often very tough but is a rich source of starch. Pound the rhizome to remove the starch and use as a flour. The pollen is also an exceptional source of starch. When the cattail is immature and still green, you can boil the female portion and eat it like corn on the cob.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Uses:</strong> The dried leaves are an excellent source of weaving material you can use to make floats and rafts. The cottony seeds make good pillow stuffing and insulation. The fluff makes excellent tinder. Dried cattails are effective insect repellents when burned.</p>

            <p><strong>Chestnut</strong>
            <em>Castanea sativa</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The European chestnut is usually a large tree, up to 18 meters (60 feet) in height.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> In temperate regions, the chestnut is found in both hardwood and coniferous forests. In the tropics, it is found in semievergreen seasonal forests. They are found over all of middle and south Europe and across middle Asia to China and Japan. They are relatively abundant along the edge of meadows and as a forest tree. The European chestnut is one of the most common varieties. Wild chestnuts in Asia belong to the related chestnut species.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> Chestnuts are highly useful as survival food. Ripe nuts are usually picked in autumn, although unripe nuts picked while green may also be used for food. Perhaps the easiest way to prepare them is to roast the ripe nuts in embers. Cooked this way, they are quite tasty, and you can eat large quantities. Another way is to boil the kernels after removing the outer shell. After boiling the nuts until fairly soft, you can mash them like potatoes.</p>

            <p><strong>Coconut</strong>
            <em>Cocos nucifera</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This tree has a single, narrow, tall trunk with a cluster of very large leaves at the top. Each leaf may be over 6 meters (20 feet) long with over 100 pairs of leaflets.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Coconut palms are found throughout the tropics. They are most abundant near coastal regions.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The nut is a valuable source of food. The milk of the young coconut is rich in sugar and vitamins and is an excellent source of liquid. The nut meat is also nutritious but is rich in oil. To preserve the meat, spread it in the sun until it is completely dry.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Uses:</strong> Use coconut oil to cook and to protect metal objects from corrosion. Also, use the oil to treat saltwater sores, sunburn, and dry skin. Use the oil in improvised torches. Use the tree trunk as building material and the leaves as thatch. Hollow out the large stump for use as a food container. The coconut husks are good flotation devices and the husk's fibers are used to weave ropes and other items. Use the gauzelike fibers at the leaf bases as strainers or use them to weave a bug net or to make a pad to use on wounds. The husk makes a good abrasive. Dried husk fiber is an excellent tinder. A smoldering husk helps to repel mosquitoes. Smoke caused by dripping coconut oil in a fire also repels mosquitoes. To render coconut oil, put the coconut meat in the sun, heat it over a slow fire, or boil it in a pot of water. Coconuts washed out to sea are a good source of fresh liquid for the sea survivor.</p>

            <p><strong>Manioc</strong>
            <em>Manihot utillissima</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Manioc is a perennial shrubby plant, 1 to 3 meters (3 to 9 feet) tall, with jointed stems and deep green, fingerlike leaves. It has large, fleshy rootstocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Manioc is widespread in all tropical climates, particularly in moist areas. Although cultivated extensively, it may be found in abandoned gardens and growing wild in many areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The rootstocks are full of starch and high in food value. Two kinds of manioc are known: bitter and sweet. Both are edible. The bitter type contains poisonous hydrocyanic acid. To prepare manioc, first grind the fresh manioc root into a pulp, then cook it for at least 1 hour to remove the bitter poison from the roots. Then flatten the pulp into cakes and bake as bread. Manioc cakes or flour will keep almost indefinitely if protected against insects and dampness. Wrap manioc in banana leaves for protection.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>For safety, always cook the roots of either type.</p>

            <p><strong>Oak</strong>
            <em>Quercus</em> species</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Oak trees have alternate leaves and acorn fruits. There are two main groups of oaks: red and white. The red oak group has leaves with bristles and smooth bark in the upper part of the tree. Red oak acorns take 2 years to mature. The white oak group has leaves without bristles and a rough bark in the upper portion of the tree. White oak acorns mature in 1 year.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Oak trees are found in many habitats throughout North America, Central America, and parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> All parts are edible, but often contain large quantities of bitter substances. White oak acorns usually have a better flavor than red oak acorns. Gather and shell the acorns. Soak red oak acorns in water for 1 to 2 days to remove the bitter substance. You can speed up this process by putting wood ashes in the water in which you soak the acorns. Boil the acorns or grind them into flour and use the flour for baking. You can use acorns that you baked until very dark as a coffee substitute.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>Tannic acid gives the acorns their bitter taste. Eating an excessive amount of acorns high in tannic acid can lead to kidney failure. Before eating acorns, leach out this chemical.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Oak (Continued)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Other Uses:</strong> Oak wood is excellent for building or burning. Small oaks can be split and cut into long thin strips (3 to 6 millimeters [1/8 to 1/4 inch] thick and 1.2 centimeters [1/3 inch] wide) used to weave mats, baskets, or frameworks for packs, sleds, furniture, etc. Oak bark soaked in water produces a tanning solution used to preserve leather.</p>

            <p><strong>Sago palm</strong>
            <em>Metroxylon sagu</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> These palms are low trees, rarely over 9 meters (27 feet) tall, with a stout, spiny trunk. The outer rind is about 5 centimeters (2 inches) thick and hard as bamboo. The rind encloses a spongy inner pith containing a high proportion of starch. It has typical palmlike leaves clustered at the tip.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> The sago palm is found in tropical rain forests. It flourishes in damp lowlands in the Malay Peninsula, New Guinea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and adjacent islands. It is found mainly in swamps and along streams, lakes, and rivers.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> These palms, when available, are of great use to the survivor. One trunk, cut just before it flowers, will yield enough sago to feed a person for 1 year. Obtain sago starch from nonflowering palms. To extract the edible sage, cut away the bark lengthwise from one half of the trunk and pound the soft, whitish inner part (pith) as fine as possible. Knead the pith in water and strain it through a coarse cloth into a container. The fine, white sago will settle in the container. Once the sago settles, it is ready for use. Squeeze off the excess water and let it dry. Cook it as pancakes or oatmeal. Two kilograms of sago is the nutritional equivalent of 1.5 kilograms of rice. The upper part of the trunk's core does not yield sago, but you can roast it in lumps over a fire. You can also eat the young sago nuts and the growing shoots or palm cabbage.</p>

One of the easiest ways of distinguishing water lettuce is by the little plantlets that grow from the margins of the leaves. These little plantlets grow in the shape of a rosette. Water lettuce plants often cover large areas in the regions where they are found.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Found in the tropics throughout the Old World in both Africa and Asia. Another kind is found in the New World tropics from Florida to South America. Water lettuce grows only in very wet places and often as a floating water plant. Look for water lettuce in still lakes, ponds, and the backwaters of rivers.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> Eat the fresh leaves like lettuce. Be careful not to dip the leaves in the contaminated water in which they are growing. Eat only the leaves that are well out of the water.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>This plant has carcinogenic properties and should only be used as a last resort.</p>

            <p><strong>Water lily</strong>
            <em>Nymphaea odorata</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> These plants have large, triangular leaves that float on the water's surface, large, fragrant flowers that are usually white, or red, and thick, fleshy rhizomes that grow in the mud.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Water lilies are found throughout much of the temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The flowers, seeds, and rhizomes are edible raw or cooked. To prepare rhizomes for eating, peel off the corky rind. Eat raw, or slice thinly, allow to dry, and then grind into flour. Dry, parch, and grind the seeds into flour.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Uses:</strong> Use the liquid resulting from boiling the thickened root in water as a medicine for diarrhea and as a gargle for sore throats.</p>

            <p><strong>Wild crab apple or wild apple</strong>
            <em>Malus</em> species</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Most wild apples look enough like domestic apples that the survivor can easily recognize them. Wild apple varieties are much smaller than cultivated kinds; the largest kinds usually do not exceed 5 to 7.5 centimeters (2 to 3 inches) in diameter, and most often are smaller. They have small, alternate, simple leaves and often have thorns. Their flowers are white or pink and their fruits reddish or yellowish.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> They are found in the savanna regions of the tropics. In temperate areas, wild apple varieties are found mainly in forested areas. Most frequently, they are found on the edge of woods or in fields. They are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> Prepare wild apples for eating in the same manner as cultivated kinds. Eat them fresh, when ripe, or cooked. Should you need to store food, cut the apples into thin slices and dry them. They are a good source of vitamins.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>Apple seeds contain cyanide compounds. Do not eat.</p>

            <p><strong>Wild desert gourd or colocynth</strong>
            <em>Citrullus colocynthis</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The wild desert gourd, a member of the watermelon family, produces a 2.4- to 3-meter-long (7 1/2- to 9-foot-long) ground-trailing vine. The perfectly round gourds are as large as an orange. They are yellow when ripe.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> This creeping plant can be found in any climatic zone, generally in desert scrub and waste areas. It grows abundantly in the Sahara, in many Arab countries, on the southeastern coast of India, and on some of the islands of the Aegean Sea. The wild desert gourd will grow in the hottest localities.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The seeds inside the ripe gourd are edible after they are completely separated from the very bitter pulp. Roast or boil the seedstheir kernels are rich in oil. The flowers are edible. The succulent stem tips can be chewed to obtain water.</p>

            <p><strong>Wild dock and wild sorrel</strong>
            <em>Rumex crispus</em> and <em>Rumex acetosella</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Wild dock is a stout plant with most of its leaves at the base of its stem that is commonly 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) long. The plants usually develop from a strong, fleshy, carrotlike taproot. Its flowers are usually very small, growing in green to purplish plumelike clusters. Wild sorrel is similar to wild dock but smaller. Many of the basal leaves are arrow-shaped. They are smaller than those of dock and contain sour juice.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> These plants can be found in almost all climatic zones of the world. They can grow in areas of high or low rainfall. Many kinds are found as weeds in fields, along roadsides, and in waste places.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> Because of the tender nature of their foliage, sorrel and dock are useful plants, especially in desert areas. You can eat their succulent leaves fresh or slightly cooked. To take away the strong taste, change the water once or twice during cookinga useful hint in preparing many kinds of wild greens.</p>

            <p><strong>Wild gourd or luffa sponge</strong>
            <em>Luffa cylindrica</em></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The luffa sponge is widely distributed and fairly typical of a wild squash. There are several dozen kinds of wild squashes in tropical regions. Like most squashes, the luffa is a vine with leaves 7.5 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches) across having 3 lobes. Some squashes have leaves twice this size. Luffa fruits are oblong or cylindrical, smooth, and many-seeded. Luffa flowers are bright yellow. The luffa fruit, when mature, is brown and resembles the cucumber.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> A member of the squash family, which also includes the watermelon, cantaloupe, and cucumber, the luffa sponge is widely cultivated throughout the tropical zone. It may be found in a semiwild state in old clearings and abandoned gardens in rain forests and semievergreen seasonal forests.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> You can boil the young green (half-ripe) fruit and eat them as a vegetable. Adding coconut milk will improve the flavor. After ripening, the luffa sponge develops an inedible spongelike texture in the interior of the fruit. You can also eat the tender shoots, flowers, and young leaves after cooking them. Roast the mature seeds a little and eat them like peanuts.</p>

            <p><strong>Wild grape vine</strong>
            <em>Vitis</em> species</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The wild grapevine climbs with the aid of tendrils. Most grapevines produce deeply lobed leaves similar to the cultivated grape. Wild grapes grow in pyramidal, hanging bunches and are black-blue to amber, or white when ripe.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Wild grapes are distributed worldwide. Some kinds are found in deserts, others in temperate forests, and others in tropical areas. Wild grapes are commonly found throughout the eastern United States as well as in the southwestern desert areas. Most kinds are rampant climbers over other vegetation. The best place to look for wild grapes is on the edges of forested areas. Wild grapes are also found in Mexico. In the Old World, wild grapes are found from the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia, the East Indies, and to Australia. Africa also has several kinds of wild grapes.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The ripe grape is the portion eaten. Grapes are rich in natural sugars and, for this reason, are much sought after as a source of energy-giving wild food. None are poisonous.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Uses:</strong> You can obtain water from severed grapevine stems. Cut off the vine at the bottom and place the cut end in a container. Make a slant-wise cut into the vine about 1.8 meters (6 feet) up on the hanging part. This cut will allow water to flow from the bottom end. As water diminishes in volume, make additional cuts farther down the vine.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>To avoid poisoning, do not eat grapelike fruits with only a single seed (moonseed).</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> <em>Allium cernuum</em> is an example of the many species of wild onions and garlics, all easily recognized by their distinctive odor.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Wild onions and garlics are found in open, sunny areas throughout the temperate regions. Cultivated varieties are found anywhere in the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The bulbs and young leaves are edible raw or cooked. Use in soup or to flavor meat.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>There are several plants with onionlike bulbs that are extremely poisonous. Be certain that the plant you are using is a true onion or garlic. Do not eat bulbs with no onion smell.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Other Uses:</strong> Eating large quantities of onions will give your body an odor that will help to repel insects. Garlic juice works as an antibiotic on wounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This shrub grows 60 centimeters to 2.5 meters (24 inches to 8 feet) high. It has alternate leaves and sharp prickles. Its flowers may be red, pink, or yellow. Its fruit, called rose hip, stays on the shrub year-round.</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat and Distribution:</strong> Look for wild roses in dry fields and open woods throughout the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
            <p><strong>Edible Parts:</strong> The flowers and buds are edible raw or boiled. In an emergency, you can peel and eat the young shoots. You can boil fresh, young leaves in water to make a tea. After the flower petals fall, eat the rose hips; the pulp is highly nutritious and an excellent source of vitamin C. Crush or grind dried rose hips to make flour.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
            <p>Eat only the outer portion of the fruit as the seeds of some species are quite prickly and can cause internal distress.</p>
